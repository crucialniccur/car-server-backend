# üöó Car Review JSON Server API

This is a lightweight backend powered by [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), hosted on [Render](https://car-server-backend.onrender.com), that serves car data for use in frontend apps. It supports full CRUD operations and is perfect for mock testing or MVPs.
